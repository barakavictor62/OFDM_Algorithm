OFDM
A form of multi-carrier transmission
a large number of relative;y narrowband subcarriers is employed during the transmiission of symbols of a signal
Tight frequency domain packing of subcarriers. The spacing is 1/Tu where Tu is the per-subcarrier modulation symbol time
Given Nc subcarriers, OFDM can be described as a block based transmission scheme since for each OFDM symbol interval, Nc symbols are transmitted in parallel.
The number of subcarriers employed and consequently the subcarrier spacing is dependent on the type of environment within which a system operates
In OFDM othorgonality is not achieved merely because of subcarrier separation but also due to the specific frequency-domain structure of each subcarrier in combination with the specific choice of subcarrier spacing which is equal to the per-subcarrier symbol rate
